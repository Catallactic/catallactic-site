# Crypto Value Chain
---
Give me a lever token long enough and a fulcrum blockchain on which to place it, and I shall move the world. Archimedes.

We are in times poor in ideas but rich in tools. The advent of programmable money brings the opoortunity to propose new economic models created by anonymous citizens without this supposing a problem or risk or the rest of society. In that way, a competency of economic models can be stablished to allow citizens choose which one suits them better. 

In this essay, first we make a review on existing currency protocols, then we are presenting Unit of Account as new kind of currency protocol. We particularize this new protocol to capture value of commodities. We also describe the value chain of cryptocommodities and propose a launchpad and token management infrastructure to relieve issuer of the management burden and to guarantee transparency, decentralization and other principles for the adopter. Finally, we also explain the challenges to implement this new model and the benefits thats brings to society.

This whitepaper does not assume you master crypto. The goal is to convince those 80% that are not yet in crypto and explain why should matter to them. And, of course, get you as an investor.
