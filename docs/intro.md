We are in times poor in ideas but rich in tools. The advent of programmable money brings, for the foirst time in human history, the opportunity to propose new economic models created by anonymous citizens without this supposing a problem or risk or the rest of society. In that way, a competency of economic models can be stablished transferring to consumersthe decision about what model suits them better. 

During the last 15 years, a plethora of cryptocurrency proposals have reached the market. Every provider has a different point of view and goals which resulted in a collision of approaches on how to understand the cryptocurrency market. The common feeling for the new comers is that they do not even know where to start.
