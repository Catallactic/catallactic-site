## DLT Networks Overview

Crypto has split layered ecosystems. Every ecosystem is composed of a L1 network, as a foundation, and a number of scaled networks following different scaling patterns. Because the technological limitations there is not a perfect network that delivers the highest standards in every feature, but instead, every network within an ecosystem, either L1 or L2, is specialized in a different set of features. 

On the other hand, different real world applications require different levels of service. There is a trade-off between critical aspects as throughtput, fees, security levels, privacy or decentralization degree (see principles). So, is up to the CryptoCommodity issuer to design the what networks will be supported for what services and split the CryptoCommodity liquidity accordingly. 

The Tokenization Platform provides the issuer the ability to move liquidity between the supported networks and the know how to make wise decisions on chains supported by the CyrptoCommodity.
