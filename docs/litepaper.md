During centuries representative money has been the preferred medium of exchange for different civilizations. The advent of electronic money brings, for the first time ever, the opportunity to create representative electronic money. This litepaper outlines a novel kind of token, CryptoCommodity. CryptoCommodity tokens are representative money in electronic form that represent the intrinsic value of an underlying asset.

## 2. Commodity Backed Stablecoins
---

Tokenized commodities are created through tokenization, with tokens issued on a blockchain network, followed by secure storage, decentralized trading facilitated by smart contracts and, finally, redemption facilitated by issuers or smart contracts.


A type of digital asset called commodity-backed cryptocurrencies is intended to provide greater stability than conventional cryptocurrencies. 

They accomplish this by pegging their value to a tangible good such as gold, oil or real estate. The physical commodity is held by a business or organization, which also releases tokens denoting a specific amount of that commodity.

The tokenâ€™s value varies in tandem with the price of the underlying commodity.

## 3. Implementing Representative Money
---

From its origins in medieval times, the historical evolution of the value debate became locked into a centuries old dialectical conflict between the objective and subjective approaches. This study has traced the waves of value theories which oscillated back and forth towards each approach, until Walras and Marshall accommodated both rivaling approaches of value within their separate General and Partial Equilibrium frameworks.
