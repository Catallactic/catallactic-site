## Abstract
---

During centuries representative money has been the preferred medium of exchange for different civilizations. The advent of electronic money brings, for the first time ever, the opportunity to create representative electronic money. This litepaper outlines a novel kind of token, CryptoCommodity. CryptoCommodity tokens are representative money in electronic form that represent the intrinsic value of an underlying asset. 

This litepaper is addressed to an advanced audience, which is able to understand the fundamentals of monetary theory. As such we wont discuss the advantages of representative money and what benefits it brings for societies as this is expected to be known by the reader.

## 2. Creating Representative Money

### 2.1. A New Medium of Exchange

To understand a CryptoCommodity lets first examine how a regular RWA stablecoin works. A regular RWA stablecoin is backed by an asset, typically a physical asset. This asset has an unknown intrinsic value. By binding 1-to-1 the supply of the stablecoin to the RWA stock as collateral, the stablecoin is able to capture the intrinsic value of the asset. However, the stablecoin knowns nothing about the marginal utility that the RWA will produce on consumers. Therefore, the stablecoin is unable to form its own price and this must be borrowed from an external source, typically an internaciobal RWA market. There are some consequences of this fact: first, according to regulations, the stablecoin must be collateralized from inception and, therefore, only issuers with enough collateral can issue an stablecoin. Secondly, as the value is provided from inception, issuers do not have a chance to fundraise. Also, issuers, must custody and, potentially, redeem the asset incurring in high operating expenses. Since the price is borrowed from a fiat source, this configuration typically creates a fiat-bound currency, and decentralization in value is compromissed. Similar features apply to stablecoins bound to currencies, either fiat or not fiat.

A CryptoCommodity is also an stablecoin but improves this process at several levels. A CryptoCommodity also binds to an asset, but it does through an utility working as proxy. The bound utility helps by providing a marginal utility when exposed to consumers.

But there is more. As an utility-proxied asset is one time event, meaning that when the utility is satisfied, the asset is consumed, is not possible to bind permanently to make an offer. By binding to this kind of asset, the CryuptoCommodity would have an continuously-growing supply. And this is not something that we want because the quality of the CrtypcCommodity would be far from optimal. In order to overcome this issue, the definition can be adapted to a "repeating utility-proxied asset", that is something that the issuer will be always able to provide periodically. Iin order to make the marginal utility quantifiable, the repeatability period must cover a known timespan where the utility provides value to the consumer, e.g. a gas cylinder provides value for one month at a cost of $16. This means that the marginal utility for consumers is $16 per month.

### 2.2. CryptoCommodity Features


Hayek said money with stable value would be preferred by users.

Real utility to empower real economy.

Configurable by issuer. Benchmarks are required.

|                                 | Value                | Collateral    |
| :-------------------------------| :--------------------| :-------------|
| Commodity Money                 | Fixed to Itself      | Itself        | 
| Representative Money            | Fixed to Bound Asset | 100%          |
| Semi Representative Money       | Fixed to Bound Asset | Configurable  |
| Fiat Money                      | Debasement           | None          |

### 2.4. Deployed on Bitcoin L2

Bitcoin L2 is being created on top of bitcoin reusing bitcoin security backed by 60.000 servers and a plethora of miners.


### 2.5. Accessible with Wallets


### 2.6. Benefits of representative money:

By exposing the intrinsic value allowing price formation corresponding to subjective perception of consumers we get the benefits of represetative money:

 - price formation according to consumers
 - productive resources allocated by consumers will
 - no cantillon
 - private risk
 - coexisting gold standard


### 2.7. A New DeFi Industry


Fundraising for entrepreneurs

Investment for investors



Despite the crypto industry is not been created with the real economy in mind, most of the existing tools can be reused to enable a new industry that brings fundraising, transactions, payments, insurance, lending, investment, trading and related financial DeFi Services for real economy amd real consumers.
