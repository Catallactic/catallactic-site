### 1.2. Commodity Backed Stablecoins

Tokenized commodities are created through tokenization, with tokens issued on a blockchain network, followed by secure storage, decentralized trading facilitated by smart contracts and, finally, redemption facilitated by issuers or smart contracts.


A type of digital asset called commodity-backed cryptocurrencies is intended to provide greater stability than conventional cryptocurrencies. 

They accomplish this by pegging their value to a tangible good such as gold, oil or real estate. The physical commodity is held by a business or organization, which also releases tokens denoting a specific amount of that commodity.

The tokenâ€™s value varies in tandem with the price of the underlying commodity.
