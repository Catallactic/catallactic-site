## 1. Introduction
---

We are in times poor in ideas but rich in tools. The advent of programmable money brings the opoortunity to propose new economic models created by anonymous citizens without this supposing a problem or risk or the rest of society. In that way, a competency of economic models can be stablished to allow citizens choose which one suits them better. 

In this essay, first we make a review on existing currency protocols, then we are presenting Unit of Account as new kind of currency protocol. We particularize this new protocol to capture value of commodities. We also describe the value chain of cryptocommodities and propose a launchpad and token management infrastructure to relieve issuer of the management burden and to guarantee transparency, decentralization and other principles for the adopter. Finally, we also explain the challenges to implement this new model and the benefits thats brings to society.

## 2. Tokenization Protocols
---

### 2.1. Crypto Protocols


### 2.2. Creating a Tokenization Protocol

In order to create a protocol we need to define 3 aspects:

- underlaying asset, service or right

- tokenization model

- scope of assigned utilities



### 2.3. Identiying the ecosystem




### 2.4. The underlaying asset, service or right

### 2.6. The tokenization model

During the last decade a new tokenization models has been proposed. Tokenization model define how the token is bound to the underlying asset and what it grants or its holders

- no underlaying asset

- utility tokens, which capture an undetermined set of utilities

- security tokens, which provide some kind o yield over a financial token

- stablecoins

- NFT which provide ownerhip of the underlying asset.

## 3. Currencies as Protocols
---


### 3.1. Economic variables

Across the history, a few economic models have been proposed. Putting these economic models in practise reuire either a broad consensus betwen the citizens or the compromise of a central planner.

* what holds the value? time, energy, commodities, work, costs, utility, capital, politics

* who determines the value, citizens), plannr top down)

* what i valu? Land Theory of Value Physiocrats), Intrinsic Theory of Value Adam Smith), Labor Theory of Value )Ricardo), Use Value / Exchange Value Theory Marx), Commodityâ€™s costs of production John Stuart Mill ), Subjective Theory of Value Menger), Marginal Utility Theory of Value Jevons), Monetary theory of value  Keynes), Power Theory of Value

## 5. CryptoCommodites as Units of Account
---

Historically, commodities has been used as basic forms of money. The problem is that they lack portability. This created the representative money or commodities backed money. However, this was replaced by fiat. Despite there is long way to go, crypto delivers the foundation to bring representative money back in a portable way.

Despite a value capture mechanism can be applied to any other assets than commodities, some requirements made commodities specially suitable.
