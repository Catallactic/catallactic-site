## 1. CryptoCommodites
---

<!-- truncate -->


### 1.1. Definition

CryptoCommodities are a specialization of Utility Tokens, built on top of a fungible asset to create a Currency Token. CryptoCommodities capture the underlying asset economic value to deliver the 3 main functions of money in the same Currency Token. 

CryptoCommodities are built on clear principle of compliance, transparency, privacy, security and decentralization with the mission to provide a tool to bost real economy, in particular, in regions with financial exclusion.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
	<img src="/img/cryptocommodities_scope3.svg" width="100%"></img>
</div>
<br/>

CryptoCommodities are designed to be applied in both, local or international scopes, as long as there is enough supply in the scope of application. CryptoCommodities promote an atmosphere of investment and entrepreneurship to empower citizens to solve their own problems.

### 1.2. Ecosystem

The CryptoCommodities are trigered or an real economy project. The project is started by a ungible asst that can be extracted and/or transormed and commercialized. 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
	<img src="/img/unit_of_account_ecosystem.svg" width="100%"></img>
</div>
<br/>

To be eligible a underlaying asset within the CryptoCommodities framework, the asset must be fungible. It can be of any nature, physical, natural, digital and there must some kind of service provided for the asset, as purchase or rent. Despite a value capture mechanism can be applied to any other assets than commodities, some requirements made commodities specially suitable.

<table>
   <tr>
    <td rowSpan={3}>Product</td>
    <td>Natural Resources</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Physical Assets</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Digital Assets</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowSpan={2}>Service</td>
    <td>Acquisition</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rent</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>


There is a natural formation in the price of the CryptoCommodity. This currency will growth a long the issuer is providing value to the society. If the provider denies to provide value, the CryptoCommodity will shrink and will be replaced by another CryptoCommodity. This will guarantee a natural selection in the value provision and a environment of wealth.

By using the CryptoCommodity a barebone of the marketplace, by extract the economic value of the asset it will be able to provide some benefit into the community. first it will make a fully featured currency which will empower the community. 

<table>
  <tr>
    <td rowSpan={3}>Monetary Utilities</td>
    <td>Medium of Exchange</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unit of Account	</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reserve of Value</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>

Besides providing a currency, the CryptoCommodity will work a foundation for additional financial services so, other citizens can propose their own CryptoCommoditi project, create their own CryptoCommodity and increae the wealt of the system.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td rowSpan={4}>Monetary Services</td>
    <td>Payments</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cards</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Transfers</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lending</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>

By issuing a CryptoCommodity the project proposer has the opportunity to fund the real economy project with fund from investors and deliver extended utilities to society a DeFi Services. A funding mechanim ha been designed and incorporated into the CryptoCommodity framework.

### 1.3. Requirements

Creating a token is not enough to guarantee it will become a currency. To deliver the 3 function of money, a cryptocommodity mut comply with the following requirement:

To work a Mean of Payment:

* comply with requirement or physical money, that is, <b>Uniform</b>, <b>Divisible</b>, <b>Portable</b>, <b>Durable</b>, <b>Scarce</b>. This is not a problm or an smart contract

* the token must be <b>Aceptable</b> and <b>Recognised</b>. This is beyond the design itself and raises 2 challenges: the velocity of circulation and the usability of the wallets.

* the token must <b>Comply with the regulations</b> in the jurisdictions where is deployed. This must be enforced by the design

* the token optionally can provide <b>Privacy</b> to its users, considering the regulation. This must be enforced by the design

To work as Store of Value:

* the price of the token must be <b>Stable price</b> to enable further utilities. This must be enforced by the design

* the token must be <b>Secure</b> and not subject to any hack. This must be enforced by the design

* the token must be <b>Decentralized</b> which means no one, even the issuer, should be able to interfere its behaviour. This must be enforced by the design

* the token must be <b>Transparent</b> and disclose all the required information to issuers, holders and regulators. This must be enforced by the design

To work as Unit of Account:

* differently to a stablecoin, a UoA needs an <b>Underlying market</b> for price formation. This must be enforced by the design

* the underlying asset must be <b>Fungible</b>. This must be enforced by the design

The aforementioned requirements must be particularized to every stage of the value chain and to each juridiction, undelying asset and utilities delivered, i.e. there must be a case by case analysis, but also a minimum set of requirements should be defined. From the list above we can collect the 7 challenges for cryptocommodities adoption in mainstream.

#### 1.3.1. The challenge of Velocity of Circulation


#### 1.3.2. The challenge of Wallets


#### 1.3.3. The challenge of Compliance


#### 1.3.4. The challenge of Privacy


#### 1.3.5. The challenge of Security


#### 1.3.6. The challenge of Decentralization


#### 1.3.7. The challenge of Transparency


### 1.4. CryptoCommodity vs Fiat Stablecoin

The only Token Model that has the purpose to become a currency today is the Stablecoin. Find below differences between CryptoCommodity and Stablecoin.

## 2. The CryptoCommodity Value Chain
---

A CryptoCommodity takes economic value from nature and delivers to the adopting society.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
	<img src="/img/token_value_chain2.svg" width="100%"></img>
</div>

All the requirements described must be particularized for each stage of the CryptoCommodity Value Chain. for example, the compliance in the funding stage is not the same as the compiance in the distribution stage. In this section we will explore every funding stage and discuss requirements and opportunities.

### 2.1. Funding

Differently to a stablecoin, which must accomplish the required collateral on inception, CryptoCommodity Framework provides the infrastructure to fund projects. Any person can work out a real world project backed by fungible assets, design a token and launch a funding campaign to fund the project.

On launching a CryptoCommodity, the monetary policy will follow an Utility Token pattern so not a collateral will be initially required. This makes launching a currency friendly for any citizen which has a real world project.

### 2.2. Negotiation

- cryptocommodity v tablcoin.Both captur pric, on rom it ownmarkt, th othr ro m intrnational markt



### 2.3. Distribution







### 2.4. DeFi Services


- rvic to ocity

- additional commiion

- decoupled from fiat

- built-in price formation

- cryptocommodity vs stablecoin. Both capture price, one from it fownmarkt, the other from international market


### 6.7. The Regresion Principle

The Regression Theorem, first proposed by Ludwig von Mises in his 1912 book The Theory of Money and Credit, states that the value of money can be traced back ("regressed") to its value as a commodity.
