## 1. Introduction
---

The following whitepaper proposes a novel kind of token, CryptoCommodity.  Whereas maintaniing an stabilization mechanmis to work as a currency, CryptoCommodities assume a built-in ecosystem that allows to form its own prices. Currencies forming their own prices deliver the true foundation for a decentralization in value, as a core principle in the blockchain industry. Additionally, forming its own prices is an empowering factor for the real economy. CryptoCommodities have being designed to allow its issuer raising capital in funding rounds to create his real economy project.

We describe how CryptoCommodities work, what are the stages, the utilities, the requirements, the challenges, the distribution mechanims and opportunities which bring for issuers, adopters and the whole society.

## 2. CryptoCommodites
---

### 2.1. Definition

CryptoCommodities are a specialization of Utility Tokens, built on top of a fungible asset to create a Currency Token. CryptoCommodities capture the underlying asset economic value to deliver the 3 main functions of money in the same Currency Token. 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
	<img src="/img/cryptocommodities_scope3.svg" width="100%"></img>
</div>
<br/>

CryptoCommodities are built on clear principle of compliance, transparency, privacy, security and decentralization with the mission to provide a tool to bost real economy, in particular, in regions with financial exclusion.

CryptoCommodities are designed to be applied in both, local or international scopes, as long as there is enough supply in the scope of application. CryptoCommodities promote an atmosphere of investment and entrepreneurship to empower citizens to solve their own problems.

### 2.2. CryptoCommodity Ecosystem

The project is based on a fungible asset that can be extracted, manufactured and/or transformed, commercialized and/or  serviced.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
	<img src="/img/unit_of_account_ecosystem_before.svg" width="80%"></img>
</div>
<br/>

A CryptoCommodity has a built-in dtsbilization mechamism, in coordination with the exchange, to capture the value of the asset from the upderlying  market. As a consequence, a CryptoCommodity includes a price formation within its ecosystem. 

The price formation is dynamic, which means, is in a continual revision. The purchasing power of the currency will growth in relation to other currencies as long the issuer is providing incremental value to the society. If the provider denies to provide value, the CryptoCommodity value will fall, and its purchasing power will be reduced. As a consequence consumers will prefer other currencies. This will encourage the issuer to provide the best practies and a environment of wealth.

To be eligible as underlaying asset within the CryptoCommodities framework, the asset must be fungible. It can be of any nature, physical, natural, digital and there must some kind of service provided for the asset, as purchase or rent. 

<table>
   <tr>
    <td rowSpan={3}>Product</td>
    <td>Natural Resources</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Physical Assets</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Digital Assets</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>

Despite a value capture mechanism can be applied to any other assets than commodities, some requirements made commodities specially suitable.

Additionally, the price is formed in the basis of a service. Some services that are suitable include:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td rowSpan={2}>Service</td>
    <td>Acquisition</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rent</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>

### 2.3 CryptoCommodity Benefits

By using the CryptoCommodity a heartbit of the marketplace, we can extract the economic value of the asset and this will allows to provide addtional benefits to the community. 

#### 2.3.1. Real Economy Projects

The CryptoCommodity Framework has been designed to enable citizens to fund and realize real economy projects. CryptoCommodities include a provision which allows the issuer to launch funding rounds and capitalize his project. The investors can be local or global.



#### 2.3.2. Currency Functions

First it will make a fully featured currency which will empower the community. 

<table>
  <tr>
    <td rowSpan={3}>Monetary Utilities</td>
    <td>Medium of Exchange</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unit of Account	</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reserve of Value</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>


#### 2.3.2. Currency Services

Besides providing a currency, the CryptoCommodity will work a foundation for additional financial services so, other citizens can propose their own CryptoCommoditi project, create their own CryptoCommodity and increae the wealt of the system.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td rowSpan={4}>Monetary Services</td>
    <td>Payments</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cards</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Transfers</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lending</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>

#### 2.3.2. Financial Services

Finally, the CryptoCommodity can deliver additional Financial Services as DeFi Services:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td rowSpan={2}>Financial Services</td>
    <td>Staking</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Liquidity Provision</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>



### 2.4. CryptoCommodity vs Fiat Stablecoin

The only Token Model that has the purpose to become a currency today is the Stablecoin. Find below differences between CryptoCommodity and Stablecoin.

|                                 | Fiat Stablecoin                                             | CryptoCommodity                                                     |

### 2.5. Who will benefit?

Extracting value from nature and delivering into society to fullfill consumers will will benefit to everyone:

- issuers will be able to fund his local or global project

- issuers will also profit by providing DeFi Services to society

- investors will profit by investing in successful projects

- consumers will benefit with higher offer

- citizens excluded from financial system will be able to fund their projects with private risk

- society will benefit from more liquid financial markets

- citizens from developing countries can create their own economy and fix their problems

- governments will be able to delegate the difficult part into citizens

## 3. The CryptoCommodity Value Chain
---

A CryptoCommodity takes economic value from nature and delivers to the adopting society.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
	<img src="/img/token_value_chain2.svg" width="100%"></img>
</div>

All the requirements described must be particularized for each stage of the CryptoCommodity Value Chain. for example, the compliance in the funding stage is not the same as the compiance in the distribution stage. In this section we will explore every funding stage and discuss requirements and opportunities.

### 3.1. Funding

Differently to a stablecoin, which must provision the collateral corresponding to initial supply on inception, CryptoCommodity Framework provides to the issuer the infrastructure to fund his project. Any person can work out a real world project backed by fungible assets, design a token and launch a funding campaign to fund the project.

#### 3.1.2. Defining Funding Rounds

On launching a CryptoCommodity, the monetary policy will follow an Utility Token pattern so not a collateral will be initially required by law. This makes launching a currency friendly for any citizen which has a real world project.

Typically there are 3 kind of finding rounds:

- private rounds

- presales

- crowdsales

Existing IDO portals are generalistic and do not play well with real worl projects. CryptoCommodity Framework provides a foundation to build ICO tools which match launching of real world projects. A custom launchpad is build-in in dAppmin.

Special attention must be paid to compliance.

#### 3.1.3. Calculating Investors Profit

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
	<img src="https://gasclick.pe/img/price_estimations_black.svg" width="70%"></img>
</div>


#### 3.1.4. Determining Vesting Schedules

With the purpose of preventing overflow in the exchanges of tokens purchased during the funding rounds on the TG, a CryptoCommodity has the potential to run vesting schedules on the purchased tokens. With or without vesting, there will be a Release Schedule. Whereas more knowledge needs to be acquired about the best practices on vesting, the funcionality is provided by the CryptoCommodity Framework.



export const SupplyProfileChart = () => {
	const pp = 1;
	function vesting(numSamples, numTokensTGE, cliff, numTokensTotal, period) {
		const amounts = [numTokensTGE];
		for (let i = 1; i <= numSamples; i += 1) {
			let data = 0;
			if(i <= cliff) data = numTokensTGE;
			else if(i >= cliff + period) data = numTokensTotal;
			else data = numTokensTGE + (i-cliff) * (numTokensTotal - numTokensTGE) / period;
			amounts.push(data);
		}
		console.log(amounts);
			return amounts;
	}
	return (

#### 3.1.5. Estimating Investors Exit

Investors in Funding Rounds will get the max profit for his investment on the Value Capture Event. The Vauek Capture Event is defined when the price of the CryptoCommodity matches the value of the underlying asset. This can be verified when the number of CryptoCommodity units in the exchanges matches the demand.

To track this variable, CryptoCommodity keeps a record of the address of all exchanges where it is deployed and traded. It is required to provide tools that allow estimating this exit according to the CryptoCommodity configuration.

### 3.2. Negotiation

Differently to a stablecoin, which is stabilized to capture the fiat price of the static asset from a broad external market, CryptoCommodity Framework includes a stabilization mechanism that allows the token to capture the economic value of the underlying from its own market. This provides a valuable tool to boost real economy.

#### 3.2.1. Mechanism

Typically ngotiation happnd by allocating tokn unit to xchang pair. Th xchang i in charg to orm th pric with th xiting pair.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
	<img src="https://gasclick.pe/img/price_determination2.svg" width="70%"></img>
</div>

In ord to implnt th tabilization mchanim, a rrv account mut back vry xchang pair. Tokn will b puld rom th rrv account to h pair whn i ncary to provid liuidity to rduc th pric. Convrly, tokn will b olvd rom th pair to th rrv account whn i ncary to rduc liuidity to th pair in ordr to rduc th pric.

#### 3.2.1. Considerations

Negotiation is highly impacted by <b>decentralization</b> as it affects the price of the asset. Decentralization at this stage must pay attention to different aspects:

- networks where the token is deployed should fulill the reuired decentralization standards. The decentralization of this networks will influde in the reputation of the CryptoCommodity

- decentralization on governance, the stabilization mechanism should ideally work standalone without the issuer needing to mint or burn manually token units.

Depending on the scope of the CryptoCommodity, <b>compliance</b> may also have to be considered as some juritdiction impose restrictive rules on investment accounts, trading diclosure or governance of the contract. A record must be kept of compliance reuirement in the juridictions to deploy and CryptoCommodity must allow reconfiguration of the compliance.

<b>Security</b> is another aspect to consider since token unit will be deployed to exchange pair and thereore subject to vulnerabilities.

The system must care about the reputation of the CryptoCommodity by enabling <b>transparency</b>. full diclosure must be provided on operation

Finally, optionally <b>privacy</b> should be included on the CryptoCommodity and lt to the consideration of the issuer according to compliance rule and personal prefFerences.


### 3.3. Distribution

Distribution is the process of handling over new CryptoCommodity units. There are 2 targets of distribution:

- genesis distribution, which refers to token units initially premined to launch the system. Includes funding round investors, team and collaborators, liquidty pools and reserves

- ongoing distribution, which refers to token units ditributed during the system operation, with operation or marketing purposes.

#### 3.3.1. Ongoing Distribution Mechanism

There are several distribution schemes that can be applied in different stages of a CryptoCommodity:

- Rewards on Community Activity

- Airdrops

- Giveaway

Is probably up to the issuer the selection of the distribution mechanims that he wants to provide but we should acomplish a full database of use cases and recommendations.

#### 3.3.2. Premined Tokens vs Fair Launch


#### 3.3.3. Considerations

An important reuirement to distribute tokens in a jurisdiction is that there should not be rules preventing currency utilities, e.g. the CryptoCommodity must be allowed as a <b>payment method</b>, if this utility is going to be provided.

Another consideration is to prevent high concentration of token units in some wallets. In particular prevent the ocurrence of <b>whales</b> as they can harm the investors experience and the reputation of the CryptoCommodity. If possible, the Gini Coefficient must be controlled. Preventing whales affects to all stages of distributionm including funding, negotiation.

## 5. Supply Management
---


### 5.1. Supply Profile

Supply Management is a critical aspect in the CryptoCommodity lifecycle as it is part of the setting reuired to deliver its features. There are several stages involved in the lifecycle of a CryptoCommodity.

- <b>Funding Rounds</b>. The process starts with an optional funding period. This period is dedicated to create one or multiple funding rounds by the issuing team and raise funds from investors to fund the project. This is an optional step.

- <b>Token Generation Event</b>. Once fuding rounds are finished, the Token Generation Event (TGE) happens. In this one time ocurring event, the initial supply is first added to the CryptoCommodity with the initial allocations as described later. The TGE timing is defined by the CryptoCurrency issuer in the schedule and roadmap.

- <b>Value Capture</b>>. After the TGE, the project activities will push up the price of the token whereas it captures the value of the underlying asset. During this stage, the more benefitial profile for the token is this of a gold standard because it will allow a quick growth of the value for investors,

- <b>Value Capture Event</b>When the demand of the asset utility on the underlying market matches the supply, it is considered that the value has been captured. This is called Value Capture Event (VCE). The VCE is a equilibrium point, and therefore, its timing can be estimated, can also be advanced or delayed by tuning the demand but cannot be precised beforehand.

- <b>Value Delivery</b>. After the Value Capture Event. the stabilization mechanism guarantees that the value of the underlying asset is maintained. This is the permanent regime where the token is focused in value delivery. During this period the DeFi Services take place.

#### 5.2. Total Supply Composition

The Total Supply for a CryptoCommodity is the number of tokens units existing in a certain moment.

The composition of Total Supply would depend on the stage in which the CryptoCommodity is working:

- during the <b>value capture period</b>, between the TGE and the VCE, the Total Supply is fixed. In this period, if the project raise expectations, the number of tokens on hands on holders grows as the demand also grows and, conversely, the number of tokens in the exchanges should shink. When demand matches token unit in the exchanges, the VCE is fired.

- the VCE triggers the stabilization mechanism which guarantees token units in the exchanges matching real demand, in order to maintain the captured underlying value. This is the <b>value delivery period</b> As the demand increases, the number of token units in the exchanges should also increase. At this point, the CryptoCommodity delivers the 3 functions of money and there are holders that store token units to keep their funds and other to trade the underlting market. On VCE also the DeFi Services initiates.

### 5.3. Consolidated Supply Management

Once the project has been funded and the value of the underlying asset has been captured we already know that the currency represents the value of the underlying asset utility. At this point the Cryptocurrency is an Unit of Account because it captures the underlaying asset utility. Also the Cryptocurrency is a Store of Value because there is enough number of transaction to provide stability to the system.

From this point onwards, a CryptoCommodity has a built-in stabilization mechanism that guarantees taht the value is always captured.

#### 5.3.1. Stabilization Mechanism

This is done by adjusting the supply in the exchanges.

Th main goal of th Unit of Account i th built-in pric ormatio mchanim. or this goal w nd to crat a ngativ dbakc loop. Thi i achivd by matching th numbr o tokn on th xchang to th xitting dmand and allowing xchang to orm th pric. Th built-in mchanim guarant that th numbr o itm conumd match th numbr th upply o th tokn in th xchang. Thror, th pric i ormd ntrily by conumr and i indpndnt o ny othr currncy.




#### 5.3.3. Determining Max Supply



#### 5.3.4. Collateral

For redeemable currencies, the goal of collateral is allow the holder to redeem its currency by the underlying asset on demand. A CryptoCommodity system is naturally collateralized, by default, by a supply equivalent to the current demand. At any moment, the issuer can redeem the holder as a regular consumer of the underlying asset utility.

A first question to understand is what volume collateralization is needed

A first question is if full collateralization is required. Increasingly, goverments are requiring to stablecoins a full collateralization of the issued supply. For fiat stablecoins this implies, storing a number of assets equivalent to the total supply. This is mainly required to prevent expansion on fiat supply with desvirtuates regulatory policies. CryptoCommodities do not increase fiat supply so they should have a diffeernt consideration for collateral.




Collateralization higher that this amount should be provisioned by the issuer in case a 100% collateralization is intended.

## 6. CryptoCommodity as Currency
---

In this section we will discuss the requirements that enable CryptoCommodity to fulfill its main functions, namely to serve as a medium of exchange, as a store of wealth, and unit of  account.

### 6.2. Quality Theory of Money

The quality of money is defined as the capacity of money, as perceived by actors, to fulfill its main functions, namely to serve as a medium of exchange, as a store of wealth, and unit of  account. The theory of the quality of money maintains that the <b>demand for money does depend on the quality of money</b>.

The theory of the quality of money, even though not under this label, has a long tradition. While many authors have discussed the factors influences the quality of money, no unifying consensus has ever been established. From Juan de Mariana (1609), Sir William Petty (1662), Adam Smith (1776), Jean Baptiste Say (1802), Nassau William Senior (1850), John Stuart Mill (1848), Carl Menger (1871), William Stanley Jevons’s (1875), Mises (1953), Rothbard (2004) provide different insights on the quality of money.

The price of money is its purchasing power. As any price, the price of money is determined by its supply and demand. <b>The demand for money is determined by its marginal utility. The utility of money is, in turn, determined by money’s quality, i.e., its capacity to fulfill its services.</b>

One of the most important properties for the quality of money is the <b>existence of a non-monetary demand in society for the money</b>. This demand can be in the form of consumption goods or factors of production. It is important for the quality of money that its non-monetary demand plays an essential role in society—everyone wants and needs it. The money is not only demanded as a medium of exchange but also for other purposes. Thus, for money, as a good, there exist many unsatisfied wants and the intensity of the wants are relatively high and permanent (Menger 1892, p. 5). <b>The non-monetary demand is important because it gives the money holder an “insurance.”</b>.

### 6.3. Quantity Theory of Money

In contrast to the hesitant qualitative monetary analysis by the economists mentioned above, there is also a current in the economic literature that does not treat qualitative issues at all. This is the simple quantity theory of money. The theory was originally formulated by Nicolaus Copernicus in 1517, whereas others mention Martín de Azpilcueta and Jean Bodin as independent originators of the theory. John Locke studied the velocity of circulation, and David Hume in 1752 used the quantity theory to develop his price–specie flow mechanism explaining balance of payments adjustments. Also Henry Thornton, John Stuart Mill and Simon Newcomb among others contributed to the development of the quantity theory. The quantity theory of money is the <b>heart of neoclassical monetary theory</b>. It has later been discussed and developed by several prominent thinkers and economists including John Locke, David Hume, Irving Fisher and Alfred Marshall. Milton Friedman made a restatement of the theory in 1956 and made it into a <b>cornerstone of monetarist</b> thinking.

The quantity theory of money is most often expressed and explained by reference to the <b>equation of exchange</b>. The equation of exchange was derived by economist John Stuart Mill. The equation states that the total amount of money that changes hands in an economy will always be equal to the total monetary value of goods and services that changes hands in an economy. In other words, the amount of nominal spending will always be equal to the amount of nominal income. The equation is as follows:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
	<img src="https://cdn.corporatefinanceinstitute.com/assets/equation-of-exchange1.png" width="60%"></img>
</div>

The <b>velocity of money</b> is a measurement of the rate at which money is exchanged in an economy. It is the number of times that money moves from one entity to another. The velocity of money also refers to how much a unit of currency is used in a given period of time. Simply put, it's the rate at which consumers and businesses in an economy collectively spend money. The velocity of money is usually measured as a ratio of gross domestic product (GDP) to a country's M1 or M2 money supply.


### 6.4. CryptoCommodity as Currency

Quantity Theory of Money does not reconciliate well with crypto. As Hayek said "The quantity theory presupposes that there is only one kind of money in circulation within a given territory, the quantity of which can be ascertained by counting its homogeneous (or near-homogeneous) units". This is not the case for private money issued in a competence reguime. This means Fisher's Exchange Equation or Velocity of Money (Token Velocity) are not theories of application for Utility Tokens and, therefore, for competing CryptoCommodities.

We must attend, therefore, to Qualitative Theory of Money in CryptoCommodity design. The quality of the CryptoCurrency as currency is the factor that must be optimized in order to get a widespread adoption. The implications of this will be discussed in the next chapter. 

Once we have understood that qualitative theory of money should be applied to CryptoCommodities, lest discuss in this chapter what are the criteria to have a quality currency.

### 6.5. CryptoCommodity as Quality Currency

Creating a token is not enough to guarantee it will become a currency. To deliver the 3 function of money, a cryptocommodity must comply with the following requirement:

To work a Mean of Payment:

* comply with requirement or physical money, that is, <b>Uniform</b>, <b>Divisible</b>, <b>Portable</b>, <b>Durable</b>, <b>Scarce</b>. This is not a problm or an smart contract

* the token must be <b>Aceptable</b> and <b>Recognised</b>. This is beyond the design itself and raises 2 challenges: the velocity of circulation and the usability of the wallets.

* the token must <b>Comply with the regulations</b> in the jurisdictions where is deployed. This must be enforced by the design

* the token optionally can provide <b>Privacy</b> to its users, considering the regulation. This must be enforced by the design

To work as Store of Value:

* the price of the token must be <b>Stable price</b> to enable further utilities. This must be enforced by the design

* the token must be <b>Secure</b> and not subject to any hack. This must be enforced by the design

* the token must be <b>Decentralized</b> which means no one, even the issuer, should be able to interfere its behaviour. This must be enforced by the design

* the token must be <b>Transparent</b> and disclose all the required information to issuers, holders and regulators. This must be enforced by the design

To work as Unit of Account:

* differently to a stablecoin, a UoA needs an <b>Underlying market</b> for price formation. This must be enforced by the design

* the underlying asset must be <b>Fungible</b>. This must be enforced by the design

The aforementioned requirements must be particularized to every stage of the value chain and to each juridiction, undelying asset and utilities delivered, i.e. there must be a case by case analysis, but also a minimum set of requirements should be defined. From the list above we can collect the 7 challenges for cryptocommodities adoption in mainstream.

#### 6.5.1. The challenge of Velocity of Circulation (Saleableness)

Velocity serves as a measurement of the rate at which money is exchanged within an economy. Most countries calculate their velocity of money using a ratio that divides Gross Domestic Product by the country's total money supply.

Analogous to the fiat world, in the crypto world we define token velocity. Token velocity measures the speed at which tokens circulate in a cryptocurrency ecosystem. When tokens change hands swiftly, it means they're being used for transactions, investments, or even just as a medium of exchange. On the flip side, if tokens stay locked away in wallets, collecting dust like forgotten treasures, their velocity is low. Low velocity might sound like a good thing at first, but as we'll discover, it's not always the case.

A token that has limited utility and lack of incentive to encourage holding of the token is likely to have a high velocity. In turn, this will reduce the opportunity for token price appreciation. Strategies that encourage token holding (e.g. staking) or that are deflationary (e.g. burning) may promote token price appreciation. However, this may have limited effect should velocity not already have reached its ceiling.

Causes of the high token velocity is that the prices are not expressed on the currency.

To understand token velocity we must distinguish the value capture stage from the value delivery stage. In the value delivery stage, the CryptoCommodity will make use t=of the stabilization mechanism to become and stablecoin. This shoud, provide guarantees to holders to keep the currency on their wallets.

##### 6.5.1.1. Token Velocity during Value Capture 

During the Vauke Capture stage the CryptoCommodity will behave as an utility token. This is the critical part where the holders can be reluctant to keep the tokens in their wallets. In order to reduce velocity some approaches can be considered:

- Introduce a profit-share mechanism

- Build staking functions into the protocol

- Balanced burn-and-mint mechanics

- Gamification to encourage holding

- for a local market, vending machines could be used to deliver the product or service

- express the prices in CryptoCommodity units


##### 6.5.1.2. Token Velocity during Value Delivery

During the Valkue Delivery Stage the token will start its stability mechanism to become stablecoin so holders will be willing to hold onto excess tokens rather than sell them for something else.

- Become a store of value. If people genuinely come to believe in a token as a store of value, there will be a significant probability that they’re willing to hold onto excess tokens rather than sell them for something else.

#### 6.5.2. The challenge of Wallets

vending machines?


#### 6.5.3. The challenge of Compliance


#### 6.5.4. The challenge of Security


#### 6.5.5. The challenge of Decentralization


#### 6.5.6. The challenge of Transparency



### 6.6. The ideal underying asset

The Regression Theorem, first proposed by Ludwig von Mises in his 1912 book The Theory of Money and Credit, states that the value of money can be traced back ("regressed") to its value as a commodity.

### 7. A decentralized commodities based economy

In this we will analyse the topic of introducing CryptoCommodity tokens in an economy with a coexisting legal tender. 

#### 7.1. Previous Discussions

The coexistence of competing private currencies has been documented from some authors. 





#### 7.2. Particular Scenario

In the previous bibliography there is the overal assumption that system is working under a free banking schenario. This situation woud require a social consensus and sponsorship for the government and seems unfeasible. the introduction of CryptoCommodity is somehow different. CryptoCommodity would complement existing legal tender.

First we need to disntighuish the scope of the introduced currencies. There can be global currencies and there can be local currencies.

 For this case we would have a incremental introduction and issuers and consumers would decide at what level they should move forward withe the adoption.


#### 7.3. Stability of a CryptoCommodity Market

## 8. At the rescue of real economy
---

Once we have designed th principles of CryptoCommodity, in this chapter we will discuss how the Financial Economy has taken 97+% of the economic landscape and how CryptoCommodity can help providing oxygen to an exhausted Real Economy.

### 8.1. Monetary Expansion of Legal Tender



#### 8.1.2. Debate on Neutrality of Money

The neutrality of money, also called neutral money, is an economic theory stating that changes in the money supply only affect nominal variables and not real variables. In other words, the amount of money printed by central banks can impact prices and wages but not the output or structure of the economy,w hich means, there is not distortion in relative prices.


<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
	<img src="/img/financial assets vs real assets March 2022_0.jpg" width="80%"></img>
</div>

price distortion



### 8.2. The Split Economy

#### 8.2.1. The real economy

The real economy concerns the production, purchase and flow of goods and services (like oil, bread and labour) within an economy. Economic activity is conceptualized as ‗real‘ because real resources are applied to produce something which people can buy and use. 

Real economy can be measured by the GDP.

#### 8.2.2. The financial economy

The financial system is mainly concerned either with moving funds around so that those who wish to buy can do so, or helping people to exchange ownership of the productive resources. Financial system is depegged from real consumer necessities.

#### 8.2.3. Comparing real vs financial economy

The following diagram is called the Exter’s Pyramid of Liquidity. It illustrates the liquidity of assets arranged from the hardest to liquidate (complex derivatives and real estate) to the most liquid asset, physical gold.

## 9. Implementation of CryptoCommodites
---

### 9.1. Smart Contract

CryptoCommodity smart contract is created as a diamond standard contract. As a diamond contract it includes 4 facets deployed at different addresses that the main contract.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
	<img src="/img/token_structure.svg" width="60%"></img>
</div>
<br/>

Every facet contains specific functions which implement its functionality. 

### 9.2. Upgradable

Every facet contains a versioned implementation of the functionality. However, they are upgradable in a way that one, or many functions, can be replaced by other functions with the same signature.

### 9.3. Security

Code includes multisig access to unctionalities.

It also creates backup of the status to allow reverting in case of vulnerability.

The whole CryptoCommodity code must be audited. Ideally should be also be in continuous validation by the community.


### 9.4. Decentralization

Decentralization is a features that should analized at different levels:

- network decentralization

- smart contract decentralization

- governance decentralization


### 9.5. Compliance

Compliance mut be reviewed according to the juridiction where the CryptoCommodity will be deployed.

<br/><br/><div class="divider div-transparent div-dot"></div><br/><br/><br/>







## 11. Conclusion
---

We have exposed how a new kind of token which takes the best of Stablecoins and best of Utility Tokens can be created. 

The token borrows from Stablecoins the concept of stabilization mechanim. However, differs to Stablecoins in how to form the price. This new token forms its own price by capturing the value generated in an underling market. This complies with initial blockchain promises of decentralizacion in value. The stabilization mechanism provides to the token a foundation to fulfill currency based utilities a payment, card, lending or transfer.

On the other hand, the new token also borrows from utility tokens the notion of funding rounds. This allows any issuer to fund his project, either globally or locally, and offer additional services to the society as defi services. The model is open to staking, launchapd, or other defi services.

We have also covered how this new token can be implemented as a diamond standard, managed by the issuing team and what are the main requirements (security, decentralization, compliance, privacy and transparency) and challenges (velocity of circulation and wallets) for its adoption.

Finally we have described how the adoption of this new token could empower the squish real economy.
