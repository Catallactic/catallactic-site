## 1. Introduction
---

The following whitepaper proposes a novel kind of token, CryptoCommodity.  Whereas maintaniing an stabilization mechanmis to work as a currency, CryptoCommodities assume a built-in ecosystem that allows to form its own prices. Currencies forming their own prices deliver the true foundation for a decentralization in value, as a core principle in the blockchain industry. Additionally, forming its own prices is an empowering factor for the real economy. CryptoCommodities have being designed to allow its issuer raising capital in funding rounds to create his real economy project.

We describe how CryptoCommodities work, what are the stages, the utilities, the requirements, the challenges, the distribution mechanims and opportunities which bring for issuers, adopters and the whole society.

### 2.1. Definition

CryptoCommodities are a specialization of Utility Tokens, built on top of a fungible asset to create a Currency Token. CryptoCommodities capture the underlying asset economic value to deliver the 3 main functions of money in the same Currency Token. 

CryptoCommodities are built on clear principle of compliance, transparency, privacy, security and decentralization with the mission to provide a tool to bost real economy, in particular, in regions with financial exclusion.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
	<img src="/img/cryptocommodities_scope3.svg" width="100%"></img>
</div>
<br/>

CryptoCommodities are designed to be applied in both, local or international scopes, as long as there is enough supply in the scope of application. CryptoCommodities promote an atmosphere of investment and entrepreneurship to empower citizens to solve their own problems.



### 2.2. Ecosystem

The CryptoCommodities are designed to create real economy projects. The project is based on a fungible asset that can be extracted, manufactured and/or transformed, commercialized and/or provide services.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
	<img src="/img/unit_of_account_ecosystem.svg" width="100%"></img>
</div>
<br/>

To be eligible a underlaying asset within the CryptoCommodities framework, the asset must be fungible. It can be of any nature, physical, natural, digital and there must some kind of service provided for the asset, as purchase or rent. Despite a value capture mechanism can be applied to any other assets than commodities, some requirements made commodities specially suitable.

<table>
   <tr>
    <td rowSpan={3}>Product</td>
    <td>Natural Resources</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Physical Assets</td>

    <td>Acquisition</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rent</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>


There is a natural formation in the price of the CryptoCommodity. This currency will growth a long the issuer is providing value to the society. If the provider denies to provide value, the CryptoCommodity will shrink and will be replaced by another CryptoCommodity. This will guarantee a natural selection in the value provision and a environment of wealth.

By using the CryptoCommodity a barebone of the marketplace, by extract the economic value of the asset it will be able to provide some benefit into the community. first it will make a fully featured currency which will empower the community. 

<table>
  <tr>
    <td rowSpan={3}>Monetary Utilities</td>
    <td>Medium of Exchange</td>
    <td></td>

  <tr>
    <td>Unit of Account	</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reserve of Value</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>

Besides providing a currency, the CryptoCommodity will work a foundation for additional financial services so, other citizens can propose their own CryptoCommoditi project, create their own CryptoCommodity and increae the wealt of the system.

<table>

    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lending</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/>

By issuing a CryptoCommodity the project proposer has the opportunity to fund the real economy project with fund from investors and deliver extended utilities to society a DeFi Services. A funding mechanim ha been designed and incorporated into the CryptoCommodity framework.

### 2.4. CryptoCommodity vs Fiat Stablecoin

The only Token Model that has the purpose to become a currency today is the Stablecoin. Find below differences between CryptoCommodity and Stablecoin.

## 3. The CryptoCommodity Value Chain
---

A CryptoCommodity takes economic value from nature and delivers to the adopting society.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
	<img src="/img/token_value_chain2.svg" width="100%"></img>
</div>

All the requirements described must be particularized for each stage of the CryptoCommodity Value Chain. for example, the compliance in the funding stage is not the same as the compiance in the distribution stage. In this section we will explore every funding stage and discuss requirements and opportunities.

### 3.1. Funding

Differently to a stablecoin, which must accomplish the required collateral on inception, CryptoCommodity Framework provides to th issuer the infrastructure to fund his project. Any person can work out a real world project backed by fungible assets, design a token and launch a funding campaign to fund the project.

On launching a CryptoCommodity, the monetary policy will follow an Utility Token pattern so not a collateral will be initially required. This makes launching a currency friendly for any citizen which has a real world project.

Launchpad is build-in in dAppmin

Special attention must be paid to compliance.


#### 3.1.1. Vesting

With the purpose of preventing overflow in the exchanges of tokens purchased during the funding rounds on the TG, a CryptoCommodity has the potential to run vesting schedules on the purchased tokens. With or without vesting, there will be a Release Schedule. Whereas more knowledge needs to be acquired about the best practices on vesting, the funcionality is provided by the CryptoCommodity Framework.

#### 3.1.1. Investors Exit

Investors in Funding Rounds will get the max profit for his investment on the Value Capture Event. The Vauek Capture Event is defined when the price of the CryptoCommodity matches the value of the underlying asset. This can be verified when the number of CryptoCommodity units in the exchanges matches the demand.

To track this variable, CryptoCommodity keeps a record of the address of all exchanges where it is deployed and traded. It is required to provide tools that allow estimating this exit according to the CryptoCommodity configuration.

#### 3.1.1. Investors Profit

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
	<img src="https://gasclick.pe/img/price_estimations_black.svg" width="70%"></img>
</div>




### 3.2. Negotiation

Differently to a stablecoin, which is stabilized to capture the fiat price of the static asset from a broad external market, CryptoCommodity Framework includes a stabilization mechanism that allows the token to capture the economic value of the underlying from its own market. This provides a valuable tool to boost real economy.

#### 3.2.1. Mechanism

Typically ngotiation happnd by allocating tokn unit to xchang pair. Th xchang i in charg to orm th pric with th xiting pair.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
	<img src="https://gasclick.pe/img/price_determination2.svg" width="70%"></img>
</div>

In ord to implnt th tabilization mchanim, a rrv account mut back vry xchang pair. Tokn will b puld rom th rrv account to h pair whn i ncary to provid liuidity to rduc th pric. Convrly, tokn will b olvd rom th pair to th rrv account whn i ncary to rduc liuidity to th pair in ordr to rduc th pric.

#### 3.2.1. Considerations

Negotiation is highly impacted by <b>decentralization</b> as it affects the price of the asset. Decentralization at this stage must pay attention to different aspects:

- networks where the token is deployed should fulill the reuired decentralization standards. The decentralization of this networks will influde in the reputation of the CryptoCommodity

- decentralization on governance, the stabilization mechanism should ideally work standalone without the issuer needing to mint or burn manually token units.

Depending on the scope of the CryptoCommodity, <b>compliance</b> may also have to be considered as some juritdiction impose restrictive rules on investment accounts, trading diclosure or governance of the contract. A record must be kept of compliance reuirement in the juridictions to deploy and CryptoCommodity must allow reconfiguration of the compliance.

<b>Security</b> is another aspect to consider since token unit will be deployed to exchange pair and thereore subject to vulnerabilities.

The system must care about the reputation of the Cryptocommodity by enabling <b>transparency</b>. full diclosure must be provided on operation

Finally, optionally <b>privacy</b> should be included on the Cryptocommodity and lt to the consideration of the issuer according to compliance rule and personal prefFerences.


### 3.3. Distribution

Distribution is the process of handling over new Cryptocommodity units. There are 2 targets of distribution:

- genesis distribution, which refers to token units initially premined to launch the system. Includes funding round investors, team and collaborators, liquidty pools and reserves

- ongoing distribution, which refers to token units ditributed during the system operation, with operation or marketing purposes.

#### 3.3.1. Ongoing Distribution Mechanism

There are several distribution schemes that can be applied in different stages of a Cryptocommodity:

- Rewards on Community Activity

- Airdrops

- Giveaway

Is probably up to the issuer the selection of the distribution mechanims that he wants to provide but we should acomplish a full database of use cases and recommendations.

#### 3.3.2. Premined Tokens vs Fair Launch


#### 3.3.3. Considerations

An important reuirement to distribute tokens in a jurisdiction is that there should not be rules preventing currency utilities, e.g. the Cryptocommodity must be allowed as a <b>payment method</b>, if this utility is going to be provided.

Another consideration is to prevent high concentration of token units in some wallets. In particular prevent the ocurrence of <b>whales</b> as they can harm the investors experience and the reputation of the Cryptocommodity. If possible, the Gini Coefficient must be controlled. Preventing whales affects to all stages of distributionm including funding, negotiation.

## 4. Supply Management

### 4.1. Supply Profile

Supply Management is a critical aspect in the CryptoCommodity lifecycle as it is part of the setting reuired to deliver its features. There are several stages involved in the lifecycle of a CryptoCommodity.

- Process starts with an optional funding period. Thi period is dedicated to create one or multiple funding round my the issuing team and raise funds from investor to fund the project,

- When fuding rounds are finished, the Token Generation Event happens. During this event, supply is first added to the CryptoCommodity and investors are allocated their purchased funds. In this TGE tokens are first added to exchages and starts getting its market price.

- After the TGE, the project activities will push up the price of the token whereas it captures the value of the underlying asset. During this stage, the more benefitial profile for the token is this of a gold standard because it will allow uick growth of the value for investors,

- When the supply in the exchanges matches the demand, it is considered that the value has been captured. This is called Value Capture Event,

- After the Value Capture Event. the stabilization mechanism guarantees that the value of the underlying asset is maintained,

## 5. Challenges and Requirements


### 5.1. Requirements

Creating a token is not enough to guarantee it will become a currency. To deliver the 3 function of money, a cryptocommodity must comply with the following requirement:

To work a Mean of Payment:

* comply with requirement or physical money, that is, <b>Uniform</b>, <b>Divisible</b>, <b>Portable</b>, <b>Durable</b>, <b>Scarce</b>. This is not a problm or an smart contract

* the token must be <b>Aceptable</b> and <b>Recognised</b>. This is beyond the design itself and raises 2 challenges: the velocity of circulation and the usability of the wallets.

* the token must <b>Comply with the regulations</b> in the jurisdictions where is deployed. This must be enforced by the design

* the token optionally can provide <b>Privacy</b> to its users, considering the regulation. This must be enforced by the design

To work as Store of Value:

* the price of the token must be <b>Stable price</b> to enable further utilities. This must be enforced by the design

* the token must be <b>Secure</b> and not subject to any hack. This must be enforced by the design

* the token must be <b>Decentralized</b> which means no one, even the issuer, should be able to interfere its behaviour. This must be enforced by the design

* the token must be <b>Transparent</b> and disclose all the required information to issuers, holders and regulators. This must be enforced by the design

To work as Unit of Account:

* differently to a stablecoin, a UoA needs an <b>Underlying market</b> for price formation. This must be enforced by the design

* the underlying asset must be <b>Fungible</b>. This must be enforced by the design

The aforementioned requirements must be particularized to every stage of the value chain and to each juridiction, undelying asset and utilities delivered, i.e. there must be a case by case analysis, but also a minimum set of requirements should be defined. From the list above we can collect the 7 challenges for cryptocommodities adoption in mainstream.

#### 5.2. The challenge of Velocity of Circulation (Saleableness)

Velocity serves as a measurement of the rate at which money is exchanged within an economy. Most countries calculate their velocity of money using a ratio that divides Gross Domestic Product by the country's total money supply.

Analogous to the fiat world, in the crypto world we define token velocity. Token velocity measures the speed at which tokens circulate in a cryptocurrency ecosystem. When tokens change hands swiftly, it means they're being used for transactions, investments, or even just as a medium of exchange. On the flip side, if tokens stay locked away in wallets, collecting dust like forgotten treasures, their velocity is low. Low velocity might sound like a good thing at first, but as we'll discover, it's not always the case.

A token that has limited utility and lack of incentive to encourage holding of the token is likely to have a high velocity. In turn, this will reduce the opportunity for token price appreciation. Strategies that encourage token holding (e.g. staking) or that are deflationary (e.g. burning) may promote token price appreciation. However, this may have limited effect should velocity not already have reached its ceiling.

Causes of the high token velocity is that the prices are not expressed on the currency.

To understand token velocity we must distinguish the value capture stage from the value delivery stage. In the value delivery stage, the Cryptocommodity will make use t=of the stabilization mechanism to become and stablecoin. This shoud, provide guarantees to holders to keep the currency on their wallets.

##### 5.2.1. Token Velocity during Value Capture 

During the Vauke Capture stage the CryptoCommodity will behave as an utility token. This is the critical part where the holders can be reluctant to keep the tokens in their wallets. In order to reduce velocity some approaches can be considered:

- Introduce a profit-share mechanism

- Build staking functions into the protocol

- Balanced burn-and-mint mechanics

- Gamification to encourage holding

- for a local market, vending machines could be used to deliver the product or service

- express the prices in CryptoCommodity units


##### 5.2.1. Token Velocity during Value Delivery

During the Valkue Delivery Stage the token will start its stability mechanism to become stablecoin so holders will be willing to hold onto excess tokens rather than sell them for something else.

- Become a store of value. If people genuinely come to believe in a token as a store of value, there will be a significant probability that they’re willing to hold onto excess tokens rather than sell them for something else.

#### 5.3. The challenge of Wallets

vending machines?


#### 5.4. The challenge of Compliance


#### 5.5. The challenge of Security


#### 5.6. The challenge of Decentralization


#### 5.7. The challenge of Transparency

## 6. Implementation of CryptoCommodites
---

### 6.1. Smart Contract

CryptoCommodity smart contract is created as a diamond standard contract. As a diamond contract it includes 4 facets deployed at different addresses that the main contract.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
	<img src="/img/token_structure.svg" width="60%"></img>
</div>
<br/>

Every facet contains specific functions which implement its functionality. 

### 6.2. Upgradable

Every facet contains a versioned implementation of the functionality. However, they are upgradable in a way that one, or many functions, can be replaced by other functions with the same signature.

### 6.3. Security

Code includes multisig access to unctionalities.

It also creates backup of the status to allow reverting in case of vulnerability.

The whole CryptoCommodity code must be audited. Ideally should be also be in continuous validation by the community.


### 6.4. Decentralization

Decentralization is a features that should analized at different levels:

- network decentralization

- smart contract decentralization

- governance decentralization


### 6.5. Compliance

Compliance mut be reviewed according to the juridiction where the CryptoCommodity will be deployed.

## 8. At the rescue of real economy
---

### 8.1. The 2 types of economy

#### 8.1.1. The real economy

The real economy concerns the production, purchase and flow of goods and services (like oil, bread and labour) within an economy. Economic activity is conceptualized as ‗real‘ because real resources are applied to produce something which people can buy and use. 

Real economy can be measured by the GDP.

#### 8.1.2. The financial economy

The financial system is mainly concerned either with moving funds around so that those who wish to buy can do so, or helping people to exchange ownership of the productive resources.

#### 8.1.3. Comparing real vs financial economy

The following diagram is called the Exter’s Pyramid of Liquidity. It illustrates the liquidity of assets arranged from the hardest to liquidate (complex derivatives and real estate) to the most liquid asset, physical gold.

</div>


### 8.2. Interaction real vs financial economy

#### 8.1.1. Monetary Expansion




#### 8.1.2. Neutrality of Money

The neutrality of money, also called neutral money, is an economic theory stating that changes in the money supply only affect nominal variables and not real variables. In other words, the amount of money printed by central banks can impact prices and wages but not the output or structure of the economy,w hich means, there is not distortion in relative prices.

#### 8.4.1 The Regresion Principle

The Regression Theorem, first proposed by Ludwig von Mises in his 1912 book The Theory of Money and Credit, states that the value of money can be traced back ("regressed") to its value as a commodity.


#### 8.4.2. Stability of a UoA Market


Th main goal of th Unit of Account i th built-in pric ormatio mchanim. or this goal w nd to crat a ngativ dbakc loop. Thi i achivd by matching th numbr o tokn on th xchang to th xitting dmand and allowing xchang to orm th pric. Th built-in mchanim guarant that th numbr o itm conumd match th numbr th upply o th tokn in th xchang. Thror, th pric i ormd ntrily by conumr and i indpndnt o ny othr currncy.

### 8.5. Comparing Economic Models


- decoupled from fiat

- built-in price formation

- cryptocommodity vs stablecoin. Both capture price, one from it fownmarkt, the other from international market





<br/><br/><div class="divider div-transparent div-dot"></div><br/><br/><br/>







## 9. Conclusion
---

We have exposed how a new kind of token which takes the best of Stablecoins and best of Utility Tokens can be created. 

The token borrows from Stablecoins the concept of stabilization mechanim. However, differs to Stablecoins in how to form the price. This new token forms its own price by capturing the value generated in an underling market. This complies with initial blockchain promises of decentralizacion in value. The stabilization mechanism provides to the token a foundation to fulfill currency based utilities a payment, card, lending or transfer.

On the other hand, the new token also borrows from utility tokens the notion of funding rounds. This allows any issuer to fund his project, either globally or locally, and offer additional services to the society as defi services. The model is open to staking, launchapd, or other defi services.

We have also covered how this new token can be implemented as a diamond standard, managed by the issuing team and what are the main requirements (security, decentralization, compliance, privacy and transparency) and challenges (velocity of circulation and wallets) for its adoption.

Finally we have described how the adoption of this new token could empower the strangled real economy.
