## 1. CryptoCommodites

<!-- truncate -->


### 1.1. Definition

A particularization o Utility Token

</div>
<br/>

Despite a value capture mechanism can be applied to any other assets than commodities, some requirements made commodities specially suitable.


### 1.2. Requirements

To deliver the 3 function of money, a cryptocommodity mut comply with th following reuirement:

To work a Mean of Payment:

* comply with requirement or physical money, that is, <b>Uniform</b>, <b>Divisible</b>, <b>Portable</b>, <b>Durable</b>, <b>Scarce</b>. This is not a problm or an smart contract

* the token must be <b>Aceptable</b> and <b>Recognised</b>. This is beyond the design itself and raises 2 challenges: the velocity of circulation and the usability of the wallets.

* the token must <b>Comply with the regulations</b> in the jurisdictions where is deployed. This must be enforced by the design

* the token optionally can provide <b>Privacy</b> to its users, considering the regulation. This must be enforced by the design

To work as Store of Value:

* the price of the token must be <b>Stable price</b> to enable further utilities. This must be enforced by the design

* the token must be <b>Secure</b> and not subject to any hack. This must be enforced by the design

* the token must be <b>Decentralized</b> which means no one, even the issuer, should be able to interfere its behaviour. This must be enforced by the design

* the token must be <b>Transparent</b> and disclose all the required information to issuers, holders and regulators. This must be enforced by the design

To work as Unit of Account:

* differently to a stablecoin, a UoA needs an <b>Underlying market</b> for price formation. This must be enforced by the design

* the underlying asset must be <b>Fungible</b>. This must be enforced by the design

From the list above we can collect the 7 challenges for cryptocommodities adoption in mainstream.

#### 1.2.1. The challenge of Velocity of Circulation


#### 1.2.2. The challenge of Wallets


#### 1.2.3. The challenge of Compliance


#### 1.2.4. The challenge of Privacy


#### 1.2.5. The challenge of Security


#### 1.2.6. The challenge of Decentralization


#### 1.2.7. The challenge of Transparency

## 2. Supply Management of CryptoCommodites

### 2.2 Consolidated Supply Managment

Th main goal of th Unit of Account i th built-in pric ormatio mchanim. or this goal w nd to crat a ngativ dbakc loop. Thi i achivd by matching th numbr o tokn on th xchang to th xitting dmand and allowing xchang to orm th pric. Th built-in mchanim guarant that th numbr o itm conumd match th numbr th upply o th tokn in th xchang. Thror, th pric i ormd ntrily by conumr and i indpndnt o ny othr currncy.

## 3. The CryptoCommodites Value Chain
---

All the requirements described in section 3 and 4, namely, currency requirements, cryptocurrency requirements and UoA requirements, must be particularized for each stage of the UoA Value Chain. for example, the compliance in the funding stage is not the same as the compiance in the distribution stage. In this section we will visit every funding stage and discuss requirements and opportunities.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
	<img src="/img/token_value_chain.svg" width="100%"></img>
</div>

Creating a token is not enough to guarantee it will become a currency. In order to get a currency, some other requirement must be fulfilled:

### 1.3. Ecosystem

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
	<img src="/img/unit_of_account_ecosystem.svg" width="100%"></img>
</div>


The aforementioned requirements must be particularized to every stage of the value chain and to each juridiction, undelying asset and utilities delivered, i.e. there must be a case by case analysis, but also a minimum set of requirements should be defined.

The next sections will discuss the main obtacles for adoption.

### 3.1. Funding


- crypcommodity allow unding 

- withouth collatral

- rgulatort advantag

ecosystem of companies

### 6.5. Stability of a UoA Market


Th main goal of th Unit of Account i th built-in pric ormatio mchanim. or this goal w nd to crat a ngativ dbakc loop.

### 6.6. Comparing Economic Models


- decoupled from fiat

- built-in price formation

- cryptocommodity vs stablecoin. Both capture price, one from it fownmarkt, the other from international market


### 6.7. The Regresion Principle

The Regression Theorem, first proposed by Ludwig von Mises in his 1912 book The Theory of Money and Credit, states that the value of money can be traced back ("regressed") to its value as a commodity.
