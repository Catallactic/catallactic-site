## 1. Introduction
---

We are in times poor in ideas but rich in tools. The adveniment of programmable money brings the opoortunity to propose new economic models created by anonymous citizens without this supposing a problem or risk or the rest o society. In that way, a competency of economic models can be stablished to allow citizens choose which one suits them better. 

In this essay, we are presenting a new kind of crypto-based currency and protocol. We also propose a launchpad and token management infrastructure to relieve issuer o th management burden and to guarantee tranparency, decentralization and other principles for the adopter.









## 2. Protocols as economic models
---


### 2.1. Economic variables

Across the history, a few economic models have been proposed. Putting this conomic modls in practis reuire either a broad consensus betwen the citizens or the compromise o a planner.

* what hold the value, time, energy, commodities, work, costs, utility, capital, politics

* who determines the value, citizens), plannr top down)

* what i valu? Land Theory of Value Physiocrats), Intrinsic Theory of Value Adam Smith), Labor Theory of Value )Ricardo), Use Value / Exchange Value Theory Marx), Commodityâ€™s costs of production John Stuart Mill ), Subjective Theory of Value Menger), Marginal Utility Theory of Value Jevons), Monetary theory of value  Keynes), Power Theory of Value

## 3. Structure of Protocols
---

In order to create a protocol we need to define 3 aspects:

- underlaying asset, service or right

- tokenization model

- scope of assigned utilities


### 3.1. The underlaying asset, service or right

<table>
   <tr>
    <td rowspan="4">Product</td>
    <td>Natural Resources</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Physical Assets</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Digital Assets</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Financial Assets</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">Service</td>
    <td>Acquisition</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rent</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Right</td>
    <td>Certifications</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>



### 3.2. The tokenization model

During the last decade a new tokenization models has been proposed. Tokenization model define how the token is bound to the underlying asset and what it grants or its holder

- no underlaying asset

- utility tokens, which capture an undetermined set of utilities

- security tokens, which provide some kind o yield over a financial token

- stablecoins

- NFT which provide ownerhip of the underlying asset. 



### 3.3. The set of attached utilities

## 4. A Unit of Account Protocol
---

A Unit of account capture the economic value in the form of a price ormd in th undlying markt. 


### 4.1. Defining the underlying asset



### 4.2. The Unit of Account Tokenization Model

A Unit of Account is an specialization o utility token where only a certain set o utilitie are part o the price ormacion mechanim.

### 4.3. Defining the core utility to account




### 4.4. Covering additional utilitie. Bound stablecoin.

## 5. CryptoCommodity as Units of Account
---

Historically, commodities has been used as basic forms of money. The problem is that they lack portability. This created the representative money or commodities backed money. However, this was replaced by fiat. Despite there is long way to go, crypto delivers the foundation to bring representative money back in a portable way.

Despite a value capture mechanism can be applied to any other assets than commodities, some requirements made commodities specially suitable.
