## How would be an Austrian Economics compliant cryptocurrency?

There is not consensus between the authors in what a currency is, what are their qualities and funcions. Below is a list of qualities for a currency mentioned in the literature.

<!-- truncate -->

The intrinsic qualities as a Medium of Exchange:

* Must be uniform

* Must be divisible

* Must be portable

* Must be durable

The extrinsic qualities as a Medium of Exchange:

* Must be scarce

* Must be acceptable

* Must be recognised

The qualities as a Store of Value:

* Must have an stable price pegged to something fairly static

The qualities as a Unit of Account:

* Needs an underlying market for price formation

* The underlying asset must be fungible

The AE compliant currency:

* Must comply with Mises's Regression Theorem, that is, its value can be traced back ("regressed") to its value as a commodity (value means marginal utility of the underlaying asset according to the subjective theory of value)

The advent of electronic money and crypto brings new requirements to a Quality CrytoCurrency:

* Must be secure

* Must be decentralized along the value chain (in network, in operation, in governance, in value)

* Must be transparent on its operations and disclose all required information

* Should probably comply with regulations where is deployed

* Can probably be private

Additional qualities could be attached to additional functions, e.g. as referred by <a href="https://www.economicsdiscussion.net/term-paper/money-term-paper/term-paper-on-money-economics/27176" target="_blank">Professor David Kinley</a>

In fact, a proper Quality Theory of Money is long overdue and should be foundation for a Currency Competition market. It is in the scope of this project to propose one. You can learn more about the Quality Theory of Money in this paper of <a href="https://mises.org/library/quality-money-0" target="_blank">Philipp Bagus</a>

Without a proper Quality Theory of Money is not possible to build Quality Cryptocurrencies and have a Currency Competition. Existing cryptocurrencies do not comply with many of the functions above and so, they cannot be ranked by quality and a Currency Competition based on Quality cannot be established.

What seems clear is that, an Austrian CryptoCurrency, should be a non-fiat stablecoin, capturing marginal utility of a commodity, plus additional features.

What do you thing? Do you recall more qualities of currencies to this list?
