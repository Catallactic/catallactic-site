# Introduction

The nature, behaviour and price of a cryptocurrency is determined by the interaction between a demand and a supply coordinated by a monetary policy. Depending on the policy we will have different types of tokens.

We will discuss the Monetary Policies in this post and leave demand and supply for next posts.

# Supply Definition Policies

On determining the token supply we can decide between 6 scenarios:

![Supply Definition Monetary Policies](./monetary_policies.svg)

On the basic Gold Standard scenario (1), the supply is fixed. No value of price is captured and the token is hyperdeflationary. this is the paradise or investors because they will see the token price growing.

If we match the Total Supply to the Number Collateral Units, the total value of the token will be captured, no matter if this value is created by primary utility (3), which makes the token redeemable, or by aggregated utility, which will create a Unit of Account (4). In the case that we want to capture the fiat price of the collateral, we must manipulate the balance of the pair in the liquidity pools, which is the case of stablecoins (2).

Finally, to capture the natural value of the collateral, as a natural Unit of Account (5), we need to match the traded supply to the number of collateral units. The problem for this case is that the token wont be reedemable.

Depending on the goal of every project, a supply definition strategy must be decided. A combination of strategies is also a valid option. The next sections will identify possible combinations of supply definition, collateral nature and capture goals.

# A cryptocurrency maturity model

A Tokenization Maturity Model could be established as a ranking of the purity in capturing the properties of the underlying asset. This model would not evaluate the value of the asset, or its utilities within the token model, but the ability of the capture process. The main criteria for this maturity model would be:

Decentralization in the network consensus. Existing great work by a16z for protocols decentralization should be referenced here
Decentralization in the smart contract
Independence from other currencies
In that way, 2 tokenization protocols capturing gold as underlying asset, could be at different level of maturity depending on the goods of the designed protocol.

The picture below represents a initial structure of the maturity model. It only considers the goal of the capture process. Sub-levels could be established to accommodate different degrees of issuer intervention.

Commodity Money would be at the highest level of the maturity Model as its value matches the value of the underlying asset. However, attention should be paid on the decentralization guaranteed by the processes of the issuer.
