# Why Catallactic?

## The crypto burden for entrepreneurs

Currently, either if you want to fund your project, or as a part of business functionalities, running your own token is a costly and uncertain mission, full of obstacles. 

You have to assemble a multidisciplinary team. You have to create and host a website, purchase, claim and vesting widgets. You have to write a whitepaper, a litepaper and some pitch decks. You need to design a roadmap. You need to plan a tokenomics, token distribution and allocations. You have to hire good developers to write some smart contracts and pass code audits. You need to build and maintain a community, publish in press, perform AMAs, hire influencers and maintain an investors agenda. You also need to get expert advisers, manipulate pools, deploy to exchanges, and perform manual vesting tasks. And do not forget compliance with all national and local regulations. And the list goes on and on.

You have to do tens of tasks with little information, lack of documentation, guidance or references. A whole IT department and a big bunch of funds are required just to launch your project. And, in this context, is difficult for interesting projects to maintain the focus in their core business and flourish.

## The biased projects

In the last 5 years, some web3 companies tried to address these problems by providing solutions to some of these tasks. First, centralized exchanges offered IEOs. Then came the IDOs. The model was sectorized to DAICOs, IGOs or ILOs. However, all of them optimized their business rules for their own benefit, and for the investors safety, at the costs of entrepreneurs flexibility. 

As a consequence of these entry barriers, crypto funding is not working on its own and, most of the crypto projects, are cloned of each other in some specific few domains. Industry evolves mainly by a diminishing number of equity-based VCs, which are financially biased, without underlying backing, and focused to endless infrastructure, gamefi, socialfi or metaverse. The self-funded projects panorama is not better and a large number of projects are directly memecoins, without other purpose that become rug-pulls or honeypots. The promising Crypto Industry looks cornered in a cul-de-sac and away from real world utility.
