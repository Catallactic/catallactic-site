# Underlying Assets

## Introduction

A cryptocurrency is made of 4 elements:
- the demand, including **the underlying asset**, the provided utilities and the value
- the supply and supply management
- the monetary policy which combines demand and supply
- the token types generated by the monetary policy

We will discuss the Underlying Assets in this post and leave the other aspects for next posts.
