When we speak about the type of tokens, we are mostly referring to how its price is formed, and maybe maintained, by the issuer. There are several strategies for price formation. This post aims to provide an overview of these strategies.

According to the nature of the asset, or asset property, that the token is pegged, existing cryptocurrencies come typically in 5 flavours: Unpegged Tokens, Utility Tokens, Security Tokens, Stablecoins and NFT. We will discuss each type below.

The more basic category would be the <b>Unpegged Tokens</b>. Unpegged tokens have not any collateral asset or asset property providing value to the token units. As they do nto have any utility, the price of these tokens is based according to purely speculative value, eg memecoins.

A large and heterogeneus list of utility tokens comes next. <b>Utility tokens</b> typically are valued by the utility, or service, provided to the participants in their ecosystem. Despite they can include some supply manipulation they do not follow a specific monetary policy to capture the underlying value or price of this service and, therefore, is delegated to their hodlers. This utility can derive from an objective, or intrinsic, value as access (GameFi), action (Play to Earn, Move to Earn, Recycle to Earn), operation (DePIN) or governance (veTokens, DAOs). This utility can also derive from a subjective value as a payments for a service e.g. network operation (utiliy coins), defi commision (exchange, lending). 

A <b>security token</b> is the blockchain equivalent of a securitized asset traded on the stock market. Similar to traditional securities, security tokens are financial instruments that represent ownership interest in an asset. Their price, yield and any other features are those of the underlying financial asset. This financial asset can be physical (e.g. real state), equity (shares, stocks), debt (short term bonds, HY bonds, US treasuries, notes) or derivatives (e.g. options).

The tokens aimed to become currencies as teh stablecoins. <b>Stablecoins</b> capture the price of an asset in the international market and set the captured price into the token. In order to maintain this price, stablecoins include a stabilization mechanism to maintain the price of the asset. This price is formed in an external market and maintained in the token by supply manipulations, either manual or automated by an Oracle. Stablecoins either can be collateralized by nothing (algorithmic stablecoins), by the asset (commodity, fiat of digital) or by a basket of products equivalent to the value of the assset (syncs).

Regarding <b>NFT tokens</b> are not in charge of any price formation by themselves. NFT tokens grant ownership of the asset to their holder and, therefore, the price of a NFT token is defined by the price of the backing asset itself. So they do not have supply or price considerations as they match on-to-one with the tokenized asset. Therefore, as they are not fungible tokens, each NFT can have a different price. Some tokens instead are created to represent some <b>identity</b> with the purpose of tracking, membership mor access. In this category we can include gobernance tokens which provide a voting power to the holder, souldbound tokens that represent a person, tracking tokens to track an asset as it progress in a supply chain.

If we look back to the literature, <b>Hayek</b> dedicated a <a href="https://mises.org/library/denationalisation-money-argument-refined">few chapters</a> to define how private money should be created according to his ideas. For Hayek, privately issued currency units should be collateralized by a basket of commodities and the issuer should announce the composition of the basket to maintain the price as compromised.

> It might be expedient that the issuing institution should from the outset announce precisely the collection of commodities in terms of which it would aim to keep the value of the 'ducat' constant

Finally, the idea for this project, <a href="https://www.catallactic.org/"><b>Catallactic</b></a> is different to all strategies above despite it borrows ideas from some. Catallactic aims to create non-fiat commodity backed stablecoins capturing the marginal utility of the underlaying asset. For these Catallactic CryptoCommodity tokens, price would be defined by the issuer and price formation delegated to the exchanges where the CryptoCommodity token is traded. CryptoCommodities includes an stabilization mechanism in which supply in the exchanges is paired to  physical demand of the commodity for the issuer in a period of time. More details about this configuration will be provided in following posts.

From the token collection above, only stablecoins and CryptoCommodities intend to have some stable price and, therefore, have a potential to become currencies.
