## 2. Currency Tokens




### 4.1. Currency Protocols

Once we have dicussed Tokenization Protocols and introduced tokens, is time now for Currencies as a new particular case of Tokens. 

Currencies, by definition, should exhibit a very stable price profile. To achieve this goal, they hould take its price from a large underlaying market with low fluctuation. This confers currencies with a specific set of utilities that more generic tokens are not suitable to fulfill.







### 4.3. Currency Utilities

Tradicionally, it ha bn aumd that th unction o mony ar 3:

There are not many requirement to use a currency token as a mean of payment beyond those applied to a physical currency.

- the main requirement probably is that it must be <b>aceptable</b> and <b>recognised</b>. And this raises 2 challenges: the velocity of circulation and the usability of the wallets.

- the token must <b>comply with the regulations</b> in the jurisdictions where is deployed. This does not mean it should be deployed in all jurisdictions, as some jurisdiction apply rules incompatible with decentralization

- the token optionally can provide <b>privacy</b> to its users, considering the regulation

#### 5.1.2. The challenge of Wallets


#### 5.1.3. The challenge of Compliance


#### 5.1.4. The challenge of Privacy

### 6.1. Store of Value Requirements

- the price of the token must be <b>stable price</b> to enable further utilities. This includes stable supply.

- the token must be <b>secure</b> and not subject to any hack

- the token must be <b>decentralized</b> which means no one, even the issuer, should be able to interfere its behaviour. As, on the other hand, we must stabililize the price, supply management techniques, such as mint/burn, reserve or stability fees, must be transparently performed by the transactional logic without manual intervention

- the token must be <b>transparent</b> and disclose all the required information to issuers, holders and regulators

## 7. Currency Tokens as Unit of Account (UoA)
---

A UoA provid a phyical backing to a currency. Thi i an additional guarant on tability. 

By adjusting the supply to the demand, a UoA captures the economic value of the asset in the market where this UoA is used as mean of payment. The exchanges are in charge of converting this value into a price, first with the tokens directly paired, and after with the rest of tokens.

### 7.2. UoA Requirements

Creating a UoA brings additional reuirement to the previous token type analized. They are as follows:

* a UoA needs fulfill requirements for a store o value

* differently to a stablecoin, a UoA needs an <b>underlying market</b> for price formation

* the underlying asset must be <b>fungible</b>.

### 7.4. Defining the core utility




### 7.5. Including additional utilities

- governance


### 7.6. The UoA Tokenization Model

A Unit of Account is an specialization of utility token where only a certain set of utilities are part of the price formacion mechanim.
