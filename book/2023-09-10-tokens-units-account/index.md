## 1. Introduction
---

Existing cryptocurrencies come mainly in 3 flavours:

- the weakest tokens are unbacked,

- utility tokens are they backed by some undetermined amount of value,

- and finally we have tokens which are artificially forced to capture a price (stablecoins, synths, security tokens).

Here we are introducing a new kind of cryptocurrency: **a Unit of Account**.

## 2. Creating Units of Account
---

A cryptocurrency capturing value, also known as an Unit of Account, is an specialization of Utility tokens that matches his supply to the marginal utility of the underlying asset or service. This quality will make the cryptocurrency fiat independent. 

Unlike stablecoins, where the price is forcedly tied to the external price of the underlying asset, an Unit of Account allows the price floating and to be freely determined by the underlying market. The value is captured wheh the supply of the currency is adjusted to match the demand of the asset.

Capturing value is a long term task and has specific requirements in order to truly represent the value of the asset. 

### 2.1. Requirements for Units of Account

Have an undrlying market for price formation. The first requirement needed by a currency capturing value of commodities is an underlying market with price formation for this commodity. To our knowledge, only Cryptogas can currently deliver this.


### 2.2. Creating Units of Account

* convrly capturing pric nds an captur priod until th arkt is big nough. This disabls a Unit o Account to captur th pric all th tim. A wll managd unit o account must includ a priod o pric captur and manag th supply.

#### 2.2.1. Defining the amount of bound assets






#### 2.2.2. Narrow down the scop of utilities to th currncy

Additional utilities can be delivered with an stablecoin.

#### 2.2.3. Match supply and demand

to captur th pric o ths utilitis
must hav a 1-to-1 rlationship btwn th supply o th cryptocurrncy and th units o th undrlaying assts

#### 2.2.4. Decentralization




### 2.3. Additional Requirements


#### 2.3.1. Security

Additionally, many other aspects of commodity value capture, as the compliance implications, reporting or security, suitable markets, driven projects, 


#### 2.3.2. Compliance

#### 2.3.3. Reporting

#### 2.3.4. Upgradeability

which can be partially upgraded over the time, e.g. new compliance requirements.

## 8. Applications of Units of Account
---

Value Capture Tokens capture the underlying value by matching their supply with number of units captured and leaving the price floating free. Tokens capturing value are considered Unit of Account or Commodity backed Money.

Once we know we can capture the intrinsic value of an asset, we can focus on what kind of assets are suitable for this process.

Historically, commodities has been used as basic forms of money. The problem is that they lack portability. This created the representative money or commodities backed money. However, this was replaced by fiat. Despite there is long way to go, crypto delivers the foundation to bring representative money back in a portable way.

Despite a value capture mechanism can be applied to any other assets than commodities, some requirements made commodities specially suitable.
