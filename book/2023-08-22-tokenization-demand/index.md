## 1. Introduction
---

The nature, behaviour and price of a cryptocurrency is determined by the interaction between a demand and a supply coordinated by a monetary policy. Depending on the policy we will have different types of tokens.

In this post we will examine the demand and leave supply and monetary policy for other posts.

## 5. Token Intrinsic Value
---

### 5.1. Definition of Value

Economic value differs according to the different Schools of Economic Thought. This is relevant because, when we design a token, we can adhere to the Economic School of our choice. Below there is simplified list of economic values:

<JSONTable theadData={Object.keys(economic_value[0])} tbodyData={economic_value}/>

All these theories of economic value can be classified in 2: 
- objective value theories. The objective, or intrinsic, theories of value hold that the value of an object, or a good, or service, is intrinsic, meaning that it can be estimated using objective measures. Most such theories look to the process of producing an item, and the costs involved in that process, as a measure of the item's intrinsic value.

- subjective value theories. The subjective theory of value, instead, states that prices of goods and services in a market are determined by the subjective preferences of consumers.

### 5.2. Tokens by Value Definition

According to the nature of the value and the way that the value is captured, we have different types of cryptocurrencies:

<JSONTable theadData={Object.keys(tokens_utility[0])} tbodyData={tokens_utility}/>

Once the value is captured, we need to provide additional utilities to the token to retain and, maybe, grow, this value to maintain velocity of circulation under controlled margins.

### 5.3. Subjective Token Value

Intrinsic value is the value that the token gains from the credibility and utility of its project.

## 6. Token Speculative Value
---

Speculative value is the value that the token gains from speculations traders make on a token's price.
